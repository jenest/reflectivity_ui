## Latest version: v2.0.33
 - Hybrid spin boxes to test out synching to plots and responsiveness.
 - Background selection is now remembered from run to run upong loading.
 - Selecting a very wide wavelength band will pick the actual band in the data.
 - Made sure cutting TOF bins matches between specular (not rebinned) and off-specular
 - Updated wavelength band.
